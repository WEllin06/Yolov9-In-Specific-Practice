As the entirety of the Yolov9 model could not be uploaded to GitHub, I have uploaded the dataset and code that I primarily utilised during my experimentation to the project. 

If you have any queries pertaining to Yolov9, please contact 22hylin@stu.edu.cn. 

If I receive the email you sent, I will endeavour to assist you with any queries you may have regarding the Yolov9 model process.

The following section will present the current graph of the application of Yolov9 to fish fry identification and counting, as well as a graph of the optimal prediction results:
