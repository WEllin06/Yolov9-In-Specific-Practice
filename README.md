As the entirety of the Yolov9 model could not be uploaded to GitHub, I have uploaded the dataset and code that I primarily utilised during my experimentation to the project. 

If you have any queries pertaining to Yolov9, please contact 22hylin@stu.edu.cn. 

If I receive the email you sent, I will endeavour to assist you with any queries you may have regarding the Yolov9 model process.
